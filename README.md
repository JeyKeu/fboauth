This application is ready to use and needs only few changes to make it work with a different app (ie. app key, app secret key).

1. Go to https://github.com/sbalak/fboauth/blob/master/Application/Models/Constants.cs 

2. Change BASE_URL with your own base url.

3. Replace FACEBOOK_APP_ID and FACEBOOK_SECRET with your own appid and appsecret.
